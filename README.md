# Computer-Science-Book-Experiment

### Here I curate a list of Computer Science / Tech books I have read / am reading. 
### I also try out the exercises and write short notes on the parts I like the best or would best help others in interviews.
### I'm attaching a link to my Goodreads account to show which book I'm currently reading : https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/170182919-shreya?shelf=tech-book-self
