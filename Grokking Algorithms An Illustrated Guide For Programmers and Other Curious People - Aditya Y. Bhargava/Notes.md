## 1. Dynamic Programming:
1. Dynamic Programming starts by solving sub-problems and builds up to solving the big problem.
2. It is useful when trying to optimize something given a constraint.
3. Every DP solution involves a grid. And the values in the grid are what you're trying to optimize.
4. The cells in the grid are the sub-problems.
5. Is there a common algorithm to solve all DP problems? No :( According to the author, Computer Scientists have said there does exist a simple algo to DP problems, that is, **The Feyman Algorithm**.
   You need to:
   a. write down the problem statement
   b. think real hard
   c. write down the solution
This is just a funny way of saying there's no hard defined formula for all DP questions.
